#code starts here
number1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))

print ("The sum of your numbers is " + str(number1 + number2))
print("Seven times your second number is " + str(7*number2))

#I changed commas to plus signs, added spaces after the text, put parentheses around the first print statement, 
#and made the numbers strings after adding them in parentheses so that they don't just concatenate. I also made the inputs integers.
